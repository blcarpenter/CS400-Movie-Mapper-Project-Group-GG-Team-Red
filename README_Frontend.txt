What Frontend.Java does is use the back end interface
and creates a display for all the movies that are added. It has three modes:
Abasic mode, A genres mode, and a ratings mode. There modes can be 
switched betweenAt a press of a button. R to enter ratings. G to enter genres. 
 X exists out of each of the modes and the whole app. 
 
TestsFrontend.java tests the frontend java class with mock inputs to make sure the correct function is done at each time. 
An example is the exit function.
